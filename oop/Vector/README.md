# Vector Class:

- The objective is to write a vector class.
- Create vectors of a specified length defining a vector as Vector v(n), with this statement
we allocate space in memory for a vector with n elements.
- Create a vector with zero length by writing the statement Vector v;
- Change the dimension of a vector v to a given length n.
- Create a vector as a copy of another vector.
- To extract the length of the vector.
- To find particular value of the vector or or assign a number to the vector.
- We would also like to set two vectors equal to each other.
- Take the inner product of two vectors.
- To write out the content of a vector via print method.
- Adding features like vector algebra, operator overloading etc.
