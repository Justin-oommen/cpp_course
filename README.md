Hello, this is a self study of C++ programming in relation with what I was taught in my masters.

After the introductory lessons, I dive deep in to the advanced concepts like objected oriented programming.
The goal is not only to learn to code but actually learn them on a way to solve physics problems.

Therefore after learning the concepts of Object oriendted programming, I will try to solve physics problems like,
- Implementing Numerical methods
- Composite Pattern and Stratergic Patterns in Physcis
- High Energy Physcis Problems
- ROOT analysis

Mostly this repository contains the worked out exercise rather than notes. I will try my best to comment the concepts during coding. If you are reading this try it out and be better than yesterday even if it is a small line of code that you implement by yourself. Learning is a big process we need consistent steps to move forward and I wish you all the best and wish me good luck also.

I will be posting the exercises as well, if you want comment email me on justinpooomen@gmail.com
