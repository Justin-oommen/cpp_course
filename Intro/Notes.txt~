#include<iostream> -- feature to load pre-built library

main - starting point of c++ program
       we also call them entry point of the c++ program
       ie, if we open the program, the main function runs first

endl - make a new line

// - comment a line
/*  */ - whatever inside is gets commented and none of it runs
