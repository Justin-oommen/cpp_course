#include<iostream> -- feature to load pre-built library

main - starting point of c++ program
       we also call them entry point of the c++ program
       ie, if we open the program, the main function runs first

endl - make a new line

// - comment a single line
/*  */ - whatever inside is gets commented and none of it runs

Compile Time Error:
	make an error in code and when compiling the compiler gives complains

Run Time Error:
    	compilation sucseeds and but when run the program it doesnot do what we want. It is a logical error. It can cause the program to crash

Warnings:
	Compilation succeeds but tells there is a problem and it warns that it will cause problems in the future.

Statements:

	- Basic unit of computation in a c++ program
	- every c++ program is a collection of statements
	- statements ends with a semi coulmn (;)
	- statements are executed in order and the order is TOP to BOTTOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A function must be declared before we use it.
It consist of
retrun_type name_of_function(parameter1, parameter2, etc){

	    statements

}

- sometimes we can call function in std::cout rather than saving in a variable anfd printing it out
  This comes in handy sometimes.
